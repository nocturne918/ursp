description: 'A reflection of my first semester at UF.'

This semester at UF was my first taste of college and a time of great self discovery. Here were the highlights:

- I learned how to crack eggs. From not knowing how scramble an egg to baking a Jiggly Cake and making Omurice, I found a love for making food.
- I became a better programmer. I came closer to mastering C++ through COP3504C and understanding Web Frameworks through UF Developer clubs.
- I discovered Gainesville. I invested $200 on a Rockrider ST100 mountain bike and ventured over a hundred miles around Gainesville.

Overall, this semester will probably be a time of my life I will always look back on. I'm looking forward to what the future holds, especially as I take more exciting classes and become more involved on-campus through research and clubs.
